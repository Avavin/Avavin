- 👋 Hi, I’m @KingAscent
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a software engineer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to do it all, as I will be self-taught.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on this journey.
- 📫 How to reach me: Through here, for now. 


**I would like to release a new project each month, but at the latest will release a new project every other month. If you have any suggestions, please reach out to me through here! I would be happy to try and bring your dreams to life!**
