- 👋 Hi, I’m @KingAscent

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on this journey.
- 📫 How to reach me: Through here, for now. 

- Currently looking at: C/C++/Any. Open to all.

- Current stance: Still open to learning and collaborating. Looking primarily for OTJ training. Willing to start at any time, on any shift. Currently looking at school or LP.

Current Project: No planned project

Current Job: Electrician (In Training)

Dream Job: Software Engineer

Motivation: All time low/Losing hope, actually it is almost 0. I just update this out of habit.
